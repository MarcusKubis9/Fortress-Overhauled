# Fortress: Overhauled

Fortress: Overhauled is an overhaul pack for the mod known as "Fortress Connected"

## WARNING: THIS OVERHAUL PACKAGE MAY CHANGE WEAPON SELECTION AND LOADOUT PRESETS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION!

This package aims to be a sort of bridge in-between Lambda Fortress: Extended and Fortress Connected, which has a few new classes and weapons but fewer than FC. while keeping QOL or major additions like L4D.
I'm also planning this package to be less goofy than FC.
