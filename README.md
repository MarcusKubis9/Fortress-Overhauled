# Fortress: Overhauled

Fortress: Overhauled is an overhaul pack for the mod known as "Fortress Connected"

This package aims to be a more dummed down version of FC that still keeps the improvements and fixes but removes most of the custom classes and weapons.

This package is what in my eyes FC should've been from the start, an improved version of LFE.

No disrespect to the Fortress Connected devs, it's your mod so you choose what to do with it. I am simply making this to hopefully open the door to a wider audience who want an experience closer to the original LFE
