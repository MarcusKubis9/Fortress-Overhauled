# Fortress: Overhauled

Fortress: Overhauled is an overhaul pack for the mod known as "Fortress Connected"

This package aims to be a more dumbed-down version of FC that retains the improvements and fixes but removes most custom classes and weapons.

In my eyes, this package should've been what Fortress Connected was from the start. an improved version of LFE, with fixes, a few new weapons, and new major additions, like L4D and MVM support.

No disrespect to the Fortress Connected devs, it's your mod so you choose what to do with it. I am simply making this to hopefully open the door to a wider audience who want an experience closer to the original LFE
