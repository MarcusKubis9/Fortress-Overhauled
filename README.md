# Fortress: Overhauled

#

### WARNING: THIS OVERHAUL PACKAGE MAY CHANGE WEAPON SELECTION AND LOADOUT PRESETS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION!

#

Fortress Overhauled is my rendition of Fortress Connected. the original plan for this overhaul package was originally supposed to be "Fortress Lite" but I have drifted away from that, I may return to that concept in the future but currently I am aiming for an alternate reality Fortress Connected ( Similar to TF2C ) that's more toned back and more in-line with LFE or TF2.

Keep in mind this overhaul package IS NOT finished and likely never will be in a state where I am permanently happy with it, so everything is subject to change.

FAQ:

#

Why is X hat missing?

Most cosmetics have been disabled for better compatibility with the grn/ylw team

#

Is this mod intended for PvP or PvE?

PvP and PvE will both be supported. I will also attempt to balance every weapon so that they are balanced in both modes.

If you are an FC dev and want to use any improvements, fixes, or weapon concepts. feel free to do so! all I ask is that I am credited.
