# NAS Overhaul Pack
## Not As Silly Overhaul Pack

This is an overhaul for the sourcemod known as "Fortress Connected" that re-writes the items_game.txt from nearly scratch, removes unnecessary classes, hats, and weapons, and moves the game away from the generally more silly base version.

Current development stage: Early Alpha
